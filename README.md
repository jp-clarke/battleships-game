# Battleships

Battleships is a Python based variation of the classic pencil and paper game (and later board game). This particular version runs in Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku. Users will play against a computer opponent and try to guess the position of the computer's ships before their own ships are destroyed.

Link to the live version is as follows:
